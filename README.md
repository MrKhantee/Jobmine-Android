Jobmine-Android
===============

A really basic jobmine viewer for android, uses HTML parsing to scrape all applications, as well as job details from the Jobmine site.
Uses Jsoup for HTML parsing and SherlockActionbar for a more ICS-like UI. 

TODO
====

* Improve UI
* Increase connection speed
* Add hourly notifications
* Have all possible job/application status available for filtering
* Be able to view Interviews
